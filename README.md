## Introduction

Welcome to FlashMinds, where learning meets innovation! Our Telegram Bot redefines the learning experience by seamlessly integrating the simplicity of flashcards with the transformative power of artificial intelligence. Explore a new dimension of learning with these features:

- üìö **Smart Flashcards**  <br>
Create flashcards effortlessly using our innovative generator. Simply send an image containing text to the bot, and it will generate a question-answer pair based on the image content. Alternatively, you can manually input questions and answers. 

- ‚ú® **AI-Powered**  <br>
Leverage advanced AI algorithms that analyze your progress and suggest tailored study materials. In study mode, FlashMinds utilizes ChatGPT to dynamically generate questions based on your saved card. This ensures varied questions while covering the same material, providing a diverse learning experience. Additionally, our algorithm identifies questions that students typically find challenging at the beginning of a session, helping you focus on areas that need attention.

- üßë‚Äçüéì**Interactive Quizzes**  <br>
 In study mode, students can view a question, reveal the answer, and self-assess their response. This interactive process enhances the learning experience, allowing for immediate reflection and improvement.

- ‚≠êÔ∏è **Progress Tracking** <br> 
Keep tabs on your learning journey. FlashMinds provides insights into your progress, helping you identify strengths and areas for improvement.

- üì± **Cross-Platform Accessibility** <br> 
Access your study materials anytime, anywhere with the convenience of Telegram. FlashMinds is accessible through any Telegram app, whether on mobile or desktop. Seamlessly pick up where you left off and continue your learning journey effortlessly.
